# langchain_chatbot

Build a custom chatbot that can extract data from a website, store it in a vector database, and retrieve relevant responses using Flask API.
This project involves building a custom chatbot that can extract data from a website, process it into embeddings, and retrieve relevant responses using a vector search mechanism. The chatbot is powered by LangChain, FAISS, and a Flask API for interaction.

 Project Workflow

1.Data Extraction:

The chatbot first scrapes text data from the target website using LangChain’s WebBaseLoader.
This ensures the chatbot has relevant knowledge from external sources.

2.Embeddings Creation:

The extracted text is processed into vector embeddings using Hugging Face’s transformer models.
These embeddings convert text into numerical representations that capture meaning.

3.Vector Store (FAISS) Implementation:

The generated embeddings are stored in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), an efficient database for similarity search.
This allows fast retrieval of information based on user queries.

4.Flask REST API Development:

A Flask API is created to serve as the chatbot’s interface.
Users send their queries to the /query endpoint, and the API searches FAISS for the most relevant answers.

5.Query Processing & Response Generation:

When a user submits a query, the system retrieves the closest matching vectors from FAISS.
The API returns the most relevant responses based on similarity scores.

Technologies Used:

LangChain → For extracting and processing text data

Hugging Face Embeddings → To generate vector representations of text

FAISS → To store and efficiently search vector embeddings

Flask → To create a REST API for chatbot interaction

Expected Outcome:

This project provides a smart chatbot API that can understand user queries and return the most relevant results based on pre-extracted knowledge. It can be further enhanced with fine-tuned models or integrated into a UI for a complete chatbot experience.
